# ToolandDieCAD
An open-source CAD tool for tool and die makers, built to be a free alternative to expensive software like SolidWorks. Work in progress!

## Getting Started
- Install: `pip install PyQt5 pythonocc-core`
- Run: `python src/main.py`
- Current Features: Displays a 3D box, starts a basic 2D sketcher (click to add points).

## Goals
- Simple sketching and extrusion for die design.
- Eventually: assemblies, tool-specific features.
