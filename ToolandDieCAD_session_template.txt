## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Build a free, open-source CAD tool for tool and die makers, rivaling SolidWorks’ sketching, 3D modeling, and die design features.
- **Why**: SolidWorks is expensive ($4,000-$8,000 + maintenance); this will be accessible for small shops and hobbyists.
- **Current Scope**: Minimum viable product (MVP) with 2D sketching, extrusion, and 3D viewing, built in Python for rapid prototyping.
- **Tech Stack**: Python 3.10, PyQt5 (GUI), pythonocc-core (OpenCASCADE for 3D geometry), Conda (environment), Git (version control).
- **My Role**: Tool and die maker, coding in free time, not a pro programmer but learning with Grok’s help.
- **Grok’s Role**: Provide code fixes, suggest features, explain CAD concepts, guide Git/setup.

## Environment Setup
- **OS**: Windows (update if changed, e.g., Linux/Mac).
- **Conda Environment**: Named `pyocc`, Python 3.10.
  - Activate: `conda activate pyocc`
  - Key packages:
    - pythonocc-core==7.8.1.1
    - pyqt (for GUI)
    - Others (list any new ones, e.g., numpy):
- **How to Run**:
  ```powershell
  cd C:\Users\Home\Documents\ToolandDieCAD\ToolandDieCAD
  conda activate pyocc
  python src\main.py
